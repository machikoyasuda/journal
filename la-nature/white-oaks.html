Thanks to @possiblybuddha for [contributing descriptions and photos](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/169121392#activity_comment_1f8c5bb0-8cc6-4a74-9192-2b8e19ff9b48).

There are 3 species found around Altadena in the [White Oaks section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Quercus_species#Section_Quercus): *Quercus berberidifolia*, *Quercus durata gabrielensis*, and *Quercus engelmanii*. You may see older observations labeled as Quercus dumosa, but this name is now used only to describe the Nuttall's Scrub Oak, which does not grow around Altadena. 

If you come upon a scrub oak around Altadena that is visibly tomentose (covered in a dense layer of short, matted, woolly hairs or down) abaxially (on the underside of the leaves) it will be QDG (Quercus durata gabrielensis). The other scrub oak option in the region is Quercus berberidifolia which is abaxially (underside of leaf) glabrous (smooth) to the naked eye. 

# Hybridization

White Oaks can hybridize with each other, complicating matters further. Quercus engelmanii is not a scrub oak, but rather a larger stature oak similar in size to a Quercus agrifolia (Coast live oak). However, the hybrid known was Ewan's Oak (Quercus x ewanii), a hybrid between QDG and QE, has been documented as a shorter, scrub like tree and also as a large stature one. 

# Examples

## QDG (Quercus durata var. gabrielensis)

Long wavy, readily visible to the naked eye. Form becomes discernible starting at 10x magnification. Tends to grow in drier areas.

## QB (Quercus berberidifolia)

Short rayed, stellate. Leaf underside appears glabrous to naked eye. Trichomes visible at 60x magnification - usually far and few between. Tends to grow in mesic (moist) areas.

)

## QE (Quercus engelmanii)

Distinctly brown, long rayed, distinctly 3-dimensional form (akin to a crumpled napkin), visible to naked eye when abundant, but are readily deciduous (lack of QE trichomes does not necessarily indicate a specimen is not of QE heritage).

## Quercus x ewanii (QDG + QE Hybrid)

Can have traits of either parent, in varying degrees. E.g. can be a large stature oak with leaf traits from QDG, or a scrub oak with leaf traits from QE (see two examples below).
