*Thanks to @possiblybuddha for [contributing descriptions and photos](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/169121392#activity_comment_1f8c5bb0-8cc6-4a74-9192-2b8e19ff9b48), and to other iNat users whose Creative Commons photos all link to their iNat observations.*

The native oaks found in Altadena are split into two sections, **Red** (section *Lobatae*), **White** (section *Quercus*) and **Intermediate** (section *Protobalanus*). Oaks within the same section can hybridize with eachother due to being more closely related.

You may see older observations of some of these labeled as *Quercus dumosa*, but this name is now used only to describe the Nuttall's Scrub Oak, which does not grow around Altadena. There are also non-native oaks planted as street trees around Altadena/Pasadena such as Quercus ilex and Quercus suber. Some folks have planted Quercus lobata or Quercus keloggii here, but their original range isn't documented as covering the San Gabriel valley.

White oaks are the most often confused, so I will cover them first.

# White Oaks

These oaks are in the [Quercus/Quercus section of the genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Quercus_species#Section_Quercus). 

If you come upon a scrub oak around Altadena that is visibly tomentose (covered in a dense layer of short, matted, woolly hairs or down) abaxially (on the underside of the leaves) it will be QDG (Quercus durata gabrielensis). The other scrub oak option in the region is Quercus berberidifolia which is abaxially (underside of leaf) glabrous (smooth) to the naked eye. 

### Hybridization

White Oaks often hybridize with each other, complicating matters further. Quercus engelmanii is not a scrub oak, but rather a larger stature oak similar in size to a Quercus agrifolia (Coast live oak). However, the hybrid known was Ewan's Oak (Quercus x ewanii), a hybrid between QDG and QE, has been documented as a shorter, scrub like tree and also as a large stature one. 

## San Gabriel Oak - QDG (*Quercus durata var. gabrielensis*)

Trichomes (hairs) long wavy, readily visible to the naked eye. Form becomes discernible starting at 10x magnification. Tends to grow in drier areas.

)

## Scrub oak - QB (*Quercus berberidifolia*)

Not very common in Altadena, but common across the state. Any scrubby/shrubby oak has a chance of being misidentified as QB because of it's generic common name "Scrub oak" (despite being one of many scrub oaks). Leaf underside (abaxial surface) appears glabrous (smooth) to naked eye. Trichomes visible at 60x magnification - usually far and few between. Tends to grow in mesic (moist) areas.

## Engelmann Oak - QE (*Quercus engelmanii*)

Trichomes distinctly brown, long rayed, distinctly 3-dimensional form (akin to a crumpled napkin), visible to naked eye when abundant, but are readily deciduous (lack of QE trichomes does not necessarily indicate a specimen is not of QE heritage).

## Quercus x ewanii (QDG + QE Hybrid)

Can have traits of either parent, in varying degrees. E.g. can be a large stature oak with leaf traits from QDG, or a scrub oak with leaf traits from QE (see two examples below).

# Intermediate Oaks

The Canyon Live Oak is the only oak in the [Quercus/Protobalanus section of the genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Quercus_species#Section_Protobalanus). 

## Canyon Live Oak - QC (*Quercus chrysolepis*)

This is a large growth habit oak. It is relatively easy to identify due to size, acorns and location. The leaves are darker green on top, lighter on the bottom, and can be serrated or not. The acrosn are very large with a distinctive cap.

# Red Oaks

There are three oaks you may come across in the [Quercus/Lobatae section of the genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Quercus_species#Section_Protobalanus). 

## California Live Oak - QAA (*Quercus agrifolia var. agrifolia*)

This is the most common Oak in California, and LA County. It is used widely as a street tree. It has a large growth habit, leaves that are serrated, cupped, and are the same dark, shiny green on top and bottom. The acorns are long and skinny with scaled cupolas.

[![](https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/217551571/original.jpg)](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/128096413)

## California Live Oak - QAA (*Quercus agrifolia var. agrifolia*)

Most people think all the Quercus agrifolia in the Altadena area are the QAA variety, but this is another more rare type that you may run into. The distinguishing factor is the degree of how tomentose (covered in a dense layer of short, matted, woolly hairs or down) the abaxial (the underside of the leaves) leaf surface is.

## Interior Live Oak - QW (*Quercus wislizeni*)

If you are hiking up in the San Gabriels at elevations above ~3000ft you may run into oak with a shrub like growth habit (in our area), and acorns that look similar to QAA
